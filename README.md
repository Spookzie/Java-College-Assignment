To run the code files, use the "App.java" > src

Each question has been implemented in separate methods labeled as "Question[question no.]"
To make finding questions easier, each commit is done with 3 questions solved

Some classes implement solutions to more than one question, so they might contain methods that may seem unnecessary for the question (but they are important for the others)

All 51 questions have been completed except for the repeated questions

***For Assignment 2 questions***
These questions have been added with numbering in continuation, so for example, Question 1 is done in method Question52()
So to each question has been implemented in separate methods labeled as "Question[51+ques_no.]"
