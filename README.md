To run the code files, use the "App.java" > src

Each question has been implemented in separate methods labeled as "Question[question no.]"
To make finding questions easier, each commit is done with 3 questions solved

Some classes implement solutions to more than one question, so they might contain methods that may seem unnecessary for the question (but they are important for the others)
